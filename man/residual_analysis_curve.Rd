\title{Plot RMSE vs. Cutoff Frequency for Residual Analysis}
\usage{
residual_analysis_curve(
  data,
  sampling_rate,
  order,
  cutoff_vec = seq(1, 20, 0.1)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Numeric vector or matrix. The vector (or columns of matrix) contains the raw signal data to be filtered.}

\item{sampling_rate}{Numeric. Sampling frequency of the data (Hz).}

\item{order}{Integer. Order of the Butterworth filter.}

\item{cutoff_vec}{Numeric vector. Vector of cutoff frequencies (Hz) to evaluate.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\item{rmses}{Numeric vector of RMSE values for each cutoff frequency.}
\item{cutoff_vec}{Numeric vector of cutoff frequencies used.}
}
\description{
This function performs a residual analysis by filtering a signal
across a range of cutoff frequencies and computing the root mean square error (RMSE)
between the raw and filtered signals. The results are plotted as RMSE vs. cutoff frequency.
}
\details{
Residual analysis is used to determine an appropriate cutoff frequency
for filtering biomechanical data. The RMSE between raw and filtered data
is computed for each cutoff, and plotted to visualize when residual noise
becomes negligible.
