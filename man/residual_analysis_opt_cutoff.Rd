\title{Determine Optimal Filter Cutoff from Residual Analysis}
\usage{
residual_analysis_opt_cutoff(
  rmses,
  cutoff_vec,
  linear_cutoff_region = c(15, 20)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{rmses}{Numeric vector. RMSE values computed from `residual_analysis_curve()`.}

\item{cutoff_vec}{Numeric vector. Cutoff frequencies corresponding to each RMSE value.}

\item{linear_cutoff_region}{Numeric vector of length 2. The lower and upper cutoff limits (Hz)
used for fitting the linear tail of the RMSE curve. Default is `c(15, 20)`.}
}
\value{
Numeric value representing the estimated optimal cutoff frequency (Hz).
}
\description{
This function estimates the optimal low-pass filter cutoff frequency
from a residual analysis curve, based on the linear region of the RMSE–cutoff plot.
}
\details{
A linear regression is fitted to the high-frequency “tail” of the RMSE curve.
The y-intercept of this regression line defines the residual threshold.
The optimal cutoff frequency is then the last frequency before RMSE exceeds this threshold.
